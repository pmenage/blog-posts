Files for the blog post on Medium called Writing a Slack ChatBot in Golang

## Requirements

- Golang
- API_TOKEN for Slack Bot

## Install and run

Set the API token in an environment variable: `export API_TOKEN=<YourSlackApiToken>`

Clone one of the examples, and you can run `go get -d ./...` to get the package dependencies.

Run `go run main.go` to run your bot. Add your bot to the channels in which you wish to use it.
